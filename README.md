# Bluecoin 3.0

After like what is it, 3 days me (someoneidoknow) and DarkBlueStealth have made the next iteration of cryptocurrency that can't even be called cryptocurrency.

NEW:
* python library i spent 5 minutes on - someoneidk
* my own server - someoneidk
* an actual domain
* better code expanadability (yippee for me and stealth)
* and more

ATM and miner will soon be uploaded
so will a wiki
so will an index page
enjoy 

(disclamer: i never tested anything more than creating an account and mining one morsel, im not responsible if the entire server gets hacked because i forgot to sanitize some SQL injection, womp womp)
